Rules:
- No fabrication. Never invent companies, tools, metrics, or dates.
- Each bullet â‰¤ 28 words. Start with a strong action verb; include a metric only if present in evidence.
- Choose one category from: {", ".join(CATEGORIES)}.
- If evidence is insufficient, omit the bullet rather than guessing.
- Output MUST be pure JSON with top-level keys: "bullets" (array) and "notes" (string or null).
- Each bullet object must be: {{"text": str, "evidence": [{{"source": str, "text": str}}], "category": str}}.
- Do not include markdown, backticks, prose, or any keys other than specified.
